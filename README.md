# Library Management System (C++ University Project)

## Overview
This is a console-based Library Management System built in C++ as a university project.  
It allows managing members, books, borrowing, returning, and reservations using object-oriented programming and data structures such as: Linked Lists, Binary Search Trees, Stacks, And Queues.

## Features

### Member Management
- Add new members
- Remove existing members
- Search members by ID
- Display all members

### Book Management
- Add new books
- Remove books
- Search books by ID
- Display all books (sorted by ID using a BST)

### Borrowing and Return
- Borrow books and track history
- View all borrow history
- View borrow history of a specific member
- Return books using a stack
- Process book returns

### Reservations
- Reserve books for members using a queue
- Process book reservations

## Technologies & Concepts
- C++ programming
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes, objects)
- Data Structures:
  - Linked List (for members and borrow history)
  - Binary Search Tree (for book inventory)
  - Stack (for returns)
  - Queue (for reservations)
- Console input/output
- Basic error handling

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Hamzahmad6/LibrarySystemCPP.git

2. Open the project in any C++ IDE (VS Code, Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, etc.)
3. Compile `main.cpp`
4. Run the executable
5. Follow the on-screen menu to interact with the library system

## What I Learned
- Designing and implementing a fully functional library system in C++
- Using multiple classes and structures for modular design
- Implementing and using key data structures (linked list, BST, stack, queue)
- Handling user input and program flow in a console application
- Debugging and managing memory in C++
